Here are the reviewers' comments:

Referee: 1 Comments to the Author This paper presents a survey of
trust management systems, focusing on the authorization decision
aspect of these systems. The paper introduces a motivating scenario
that emphasizes the dynamic requirements of authorization decisions in
cross-domain settings, and then describes the details of three systems
representative of this field. Several tables offer comparisons of 12
TM systems that have been described in the literature.

The paper is well written and fairly easy to understand. The primary
technical content is targeted to those with expertise in formal logic,
so this may be of limited interested to this journal audience.

The paper is organized well. I found that section 4 interrupted the
flow of the trust management features (section 3) and the systems
review (section 5) with more background material. Perhaps section 4
should occur earlier in the paper, or be dropped/condensed to condense
the paper or make room for more material regarding the systems.

Trust management is a broad field, as the paper explains. Since the
focus is on authorization, maybe the title can be modified to better
reflect the topic of the paper. My suggestion is "Authorization in
Trust Management System".

Page 8, line 15 
This section introduces the running example used
throughout the paper. I like the approach of introducing a compelling
scenario and then examining how each system supports the
example. However, the integration is not as clean as I expected it to
be, and I’m wondering if the relationship can be clarified. Section
2.5 describes the situation abstractly, yet it mentions specifically
that includes 5 certificates in his request to the hospital database.
When I look at each system implementation, I don’t see these five
certificates defined and the same specific example shown clearly. Does
each of these systems have the same semantics that lead to these same
5 certificates when solving this problem? If not, is the example in
2.5 posing a particular implementation, but there are other ways to
solve it? How do the three systems support the notion of negative
credentials that is hinted at near the end of 2.5?

Page 8, Section 3
The list of features in section 3 overlaps somewhat with the set of
requirements enumerated in the following article: K. E. Seamons,
M. Winslett, T. Yu, B. Smith, E. Child, J. Jacobson, H. Mills, and
L. Yu. Requirements for Policy Languages for Trust Negotiation. 3rd
International Workshop on Policies for Distributed Systems and
Networks (POLICY 2002), Monterey, CA, June 2002.  The authors might
consider referencing this paper as an example of earlier work that
also compared TM systems according to a set of criteria (including
several of the systems compared in this work).

Page 9 Line 45: 
What is the meaning of the term negative credentials?
Some systems distinguish between credentials and policies –
credentials encode properties or attributes about their owners and
policies encode the rules that govern access. In this case, the policy
language may support negation “Do not allow access to anyone with
the Dave credential,” but the credentials are simply statements of
fact. Other systems unify the notion of policies and credentials such
that credentials encode the attributes of an owner as well as access
control rules.

Page 10-11:
In Tables I and II, is there a reason for how the columns are ordered?
For the most part, they occur in the order of the systems presented in
5.4. It seems more natural to me to list the three primary systems
that were analyzed together as the first three columns of Table I,
unless there is some justification for the current order that I’m not
recognizing.?

Page 13, section 3.1.8
A key notion of certificate validity that is not mentioned in this
section is that of ownership – does the entity presenting the
certificate own the certificate (i.e., know the private key). Do all
of the systems that explicitly handle this issue also support a proof
of ownership protocol (something like the TLS handshake protocol that
includes a certificate ownership proof)?

Page 14, section 3.1.10 
This section ends by mentioning that some
certificate discovery approaches (Li et al, and Gunter et al.) are
part of the system’s formalism and is not left to ad hoc techniques. I
assume TPL’s support for this is an example of an ad hoc technique. It
might be helpful to clarify in the Table whether each system that
supports this feature is using a formal or ad hoc approach.

Page 16, line 23
The explanation for ABLP is repeated (see page
14, line 21). I think explaining this once on page 16 is sufficient.

Page 19, line 7 
This survey is not an exhaustive list of TM
systems. Are there other more important systems to include in the
survey or to replace some of the systems in the survey? I suggest
X-Sec [Bertino et al] and PeerTrust/PeerAccess [Winslett et al.] as
two systems worthy of consideration. In my opinion, they offer more
important research contributions than either TPL or REFEREE. Just how
many other systems are there? It might make a nice contribution to
cite them so that researchers (especially students) who read this
article can get a concrete idea of where to look to go beyond this
paper.

Title: Trust Management: Features and foundations

Authors: Chapin, Skalka, Wang

This survey on trust management focusses on a specific part - or
component - of trust negotiation frameworks, namely, the one devoted
to authorization decisions, with particular attention to the features
and structure of the related policy language.

This approach is reasonable.  The issues covered by the paper are
nicely presented, nicely organized and carefully analyzed.

However the paper has some drawbacks and gaps.  It does not mention
several advanced frameworks.  It focusses on policy language features
that are just as relevant in traditional application scenarios as in
modern trust management scenarios, while the novelty needed in the
latter are not dealt with - including the special requirements posed
on policy languages by negotiation frameworks.  Other improvements
will be suggested in the detailed comments below.

For these reasons I suggest to fix these gaps before publishing the
paper. The extra work needed is nontrivial enough to require a second
round of review.

DETAILED COMMENTS:

A. MISSING REFERENCES

Trust negotiation has some of its strongest motivations in the need
for protecting not only a server's resources, but also the credentials
of the requestors.  The first paper proposing a uniform solution to
this issue is not mentioned in the survey:

@inproceedings{bs00,
 author = {P.A. Bonatti and P. Samarati},
 title = {Regulating service access and information release on the Web},
 booktitle = {CCS '00: Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on computer and communications security},
 year = {2000},
 isbn = {1-58113-203-4},
 pages = {134--143},
 location = {Athens, Greece},
 doi = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/352600.352620},
 publisher = {ACM Press},
 }

Until 2002 this approach has been the most complete framework according to another important paper not cited in the survey.
 
 @misc{ seamons02requirements,
  author = "K. Seamons and M. Winslett and T. Yu and B. Smith and E. Child and J. Jacobson
    and H. Mills and L. Yu",
  title = "Requirements for Policy Languages for Trust Negotiation",
  text = "K. Seamons, M. Winslett, T. Yu, B. Smith, E. Child, J. Jacobson, H. Mills,
    L. Yu, Requirements for Policy Languages for Trust Negotiation, Third International
    Workshop on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks (POLICY 2002.",
  year = "2002",
  url = "citeseer.ist.psu.edu/606705.html" }


The authors should read this paper and take care of all the requirements not yet handled in their survey.

A second important implemented framework missing from the survey is
PeerTrust. Lots of information - including online demos - can be found
on the project's web site at L3S (Learning Lab of Lower Saxony).  An
introductory paper is

@InProceedings{peertrust-esws-04,
  author =       {Rita Gavriloaie and Wolfgang Nejdl and Daniel Olmedilla
                  and Kent Seamons and Marianne Winslett},
  title =        {No Registration Needed: How to Use Declarative Policies and
                  Negotiation to Access Sensitive Resources on the
                  Semantic Web},
  booktitle =    {1st First European Semantic Web Symposium},
  year =         2004,
  address =      {Heraklion, Greece},
  month =        may
}

The third missing line of work is Protune, the trust negotiation
framework developed by the Policy group of the network of excellence
REWERSE.  Protune parameterizes and extends PeerTrust in a number of
ways, and decouples authorizations from negotiation control through a
suitable metalanguage.  See REWERSE's policy group web site (all
deliverables are public) and


@InProceedings{protune-05,
  author =       {Piero A. Bonatti and Daniel Olmedilla},
  title =        {Driving and Monitoring Provisional Trust Negotiation with Metapolicies},
  booktitle =    {{IEEE} 6th International Workshop on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks ({POLICY} 2005)},
  year =         2005,
  address =      {Stockholm, Sweden},
  month =        jun
}


Both PeerTrust and Protune are based on Datalog and are decidable
(with the usual PTIME data-complexity and EXPTIME program-complexity
results).

Moreover, the survey disregards the approaches based on description
logics, such as Kaos and REI (decidable and PSPACE-hard).


B. TERMINOLOGY

I appreciated that a section has been devoted to terminology (2.2).
However I have some objections to some of the definitions adopted.

B1) By "proof of compliance" one usually refers to a certifiable proof
that some right is granted.  Such proofs can be used to convince a
third party that a peer has the right to do something, which has
several applications including accountability and non-repudiation.
Therefore "proof of compliance" should not be regarded as a synonym of
"authorization decision".  Relevant techniques may require signed
proof trees and the like.

B2) "Roles" are not "groups".  A group member is *always* a member
(until it leaves the group or is banned by the group).  A role may be
*activated discretionally* by a user at each transaction; role
privileges are available only if the role is active.  Selective role
activation is very important to make the need-to-know principle more
flexible.  While some trust negotiation papers tend to blur this
distinction, the RBAC community is very careful in maintaining the
conceptual distinction between the two terms, and I think here we
should do the same - or argue convincingly that this distinction is
meaningless in trust management scenarios...

C. ABSTRACT MODEL OF AUTHORIZATION DECISIONS

Basically, we are talking about Fig.1.  A yes/no output is definitely
not state-of-the-art.  The authorization component in many cases
outputs a conditional answer "yes if ..." or a cooperative answer "no
but you might ...", or a failure explanation "no because ...".  The
same view applies to the interaction between the enclosing system (eg
a negotiation manager) and the authorization component, as well as the
interaction between clients and servers.

The dotted backward arrow and the explanation in the second paragraph
of p.7 do not address my objection because the output of that step
*is* the conditional/cooperative answer in several frameworks, e.g.,
consider the cases in which the peer in charge to search for and
provide the missing credential is the requestor.  The backward arrow
only accounts for a locally driven procedure for credential harvesting
that eventually returns control back to the yes/no decision procedure.

The need for such cooperative kinds of answers has been raised and
advocated in several panels and seminars during the last two years -
see for example the Zeitgeist panel at the Semantic Web policy
Workshop (ISWC'05), the tutorial on semantic web policies at ESWC'06,
and REWERSE's position paper at the same conference titled:

  Semantic Web Policies - A Discussion of Requirements and Research Issues.

Indeed Protune supports this approach and features an integrated
explanation facility:


@inproceedings{ protune-explanations-06,
  author =       {Piero A. Bonatti and
                  Daniel Olmedilla and
                  Joachim Peer},
  title =        {Advanced Policy Queries},
  booktitle = {ECAI 2006, 17th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence},
  publisher = {IOS Press},
  year      = {2006},
  isbn      = {1-58603-642-4},
  pages     = {200-204},
 }

The underlying reasoning mechanisms are not based on logical
consequences (unlike the frameworks mentioned in the survey) but
rather on partial evaluation and abduction.

D. RUNNING EXAMPLE

It does not cover 2-way negotiations, where the requestor reacts to a
credential request with a counter request (say, because the requestor
is willing to release its credit card only to BBB members - this
example is due to Marianne Winslett I believe).

As such, this example is not revealing the limitations of the oldest frameworks, such as the ones to which the survey devotes its attention and preferences. 


E. ASYMMETRIC EXPRESSIVENESS ANALYSIS

The choice of some "expressiveness tests", or features, is to some
extent arbitrary.  While separation of duties and threshold policies
are perhaps more common than other policies, why should the survey not
care about - say - Chinese Walls?

If the purpose is comparing the expressive power of policy languages,
then a characterization based on computational complexity would be
much more general and precise.  A related question is: How can you
*prove* that REFEREE, SD3 and Binder cannot express threshold policies
indirectly?

A similar comment holds for certificate validity.  Why not talking
about the ability of placing constraints on arbitrary credential
attributes, instead? Credential validity then becomes just a special
case of the picture.


F. MISSING CRITERIA

The classification adopted disregards important aspects of policy
languages for trust management and trust negotiation.  Aspects such as
interoperability with external (eg legacy) software and data,
interoperability among heterogeneous peers (involving ontology
issues), accountability, extensibility, usability, and
reputation-based trust are not even mentioned!

These aspects are absolutely crucial for the distributed scenarios
that trust management is meant to tackle, and these are the aspects
that pose novel requirements on policy languages.  The missing
references tackle several of these issues to some extent.


G. PROGRAMMING LOGICS

G1) Datalog is not a programming language - it is as declarative as
any pure query language.

G2) The authors write: "it has been argued that [XSB] adds too much
size and complexity to the implementation for authorization
decisions".  I don't remember this claim, at least not in such general
terms - please insert a citation.

G3) The discussion of nonmonotonic negation is naive.  First, Datalog
has been extended with nonmonotonic negation years ago
(Datalog$^\neg$), see the papers by Eiter and Gottlob for example, and
the LDL system.  Second, stratified negation is not problematic at
all, from a technical point of view.  Third, certificate negation and
revocation are not good motivations for negation: Certificate negation
is deprecated in [seamons02requirements], and revocation is usually
accomplished by scanning a black list of credentials (no negation
needed!).  See the following survey for a refined discussion of
negation as failure in traditional policu languages:

@InCollection{leads-security,
    author = {P.A. Bonatti and P. Samarati},
    editor = {J. Chomicki and R. van der Meyden and G. Saake},
    booktitle = {Logics for Emerging Applications of Databases},
    title = {Logics for Authorizations and Security},
    publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
    year = {2003},
}


H. EMPHASIS ON QCM/SD3

This issue cleary shows that the current survey is missing the new
requirements posed by open trust management scenarios.  QCM/SD3 are
claimed to be the state-of-the-art in trust management because their
implementation relies on mature distributed database technology.

However, this approach is made possible because QCM and SD3 support
neither 2-way negotiations (see the aforementioned example by Winslett
(?)) nor rich answers (cf point C).  This is what makes authorization
decisions similar to traditional queries.  Of course, for this reason
I disagree with the authors: QCM/SD3 is not a state-of-the-art trust
management framework.  I can only agree that it would be nice to have
such mature technology available for the advanced languages that trust
management and trust negotiation call for.

Note that in the examples illustrating QCM and SD3 credentials are
used for a quite nonstandard purpose, namely, as replacements of
remote queries.

A last remark: the QCM/SD3 approach requires shared knowledge of
remote database schemata as opposed to credential structure.
Apparently, the latter would be preferable and more natural in
reference scenarios.  A priori knowledge of database schemata may
easily become an onstacle to interoperability between heterogeneous
peers.

Review of:

Trust Management: Features and Foundations

Peter Chapin, Christian Skalka, and Sean Wang


This article gives a very nice and much needed survey of the field of
Trust Management (TM).  Being now just over 10 years old, this area
has received a lot of research attention by diverse groups, but has
not yet been surveyed in a comprehensive manner.  While the current
article is not exhaustive, it does analyze the characteristics of 12
different TM systems, presenting four in some detail.  A running
example is used to good effect.

The article has many other nice features.  It provides a nice
introduction of TM concept and systems for non-experts.  It has a
glossary that, with a couple improvements, will be very helpful to the
reader.  It provides a graphical model of the components of a generic
TM system that it uses to frame its discussion of the many systems it
considers.  It presents in tabular format the main features of the
following 12 TM systems: Policy Maker, Keynote, SPKI/SDSI, Referee,
QCM, OASIS, PCA, TPL, SD3, Binder, RT, and Cassandra.  It gives a
brief introduction to three logics that are utilized and extended by
the TM systems surveyed: BAN Logic, ABLP Logic, and Programming Logic.
The four systems it covers in some detail (features, running example,
semantics, and implementation) are SPKI/SDSI, RT, and QCM, and SD3.
These are chosen as being representative.  The discussion of the
remaining seven TM systems is less systematic (Policy Maker, KeyNote,
Referee, OASIS, PCA, TPL, Binder, and Cassandra).

There are some weakness and inaccuracies that must be corrected before
the article should be published.  However, I have every confidence
that the authors will be able to fix these problems.

The first problem that must be fixed concerns the difference between
non-monotonic languages and credential revocation.  The authors
conflate these issues in section 3.1.9, though they are quite
distinct. In a non-monotonic language, such as TPL, one can write a
policy requiring that authorized users not have, for instance,
certificates indicating that they are felons.  This is a tricky
feature to manage in general, since failure to obtain an existing
credential could lead to an incorrect, positive authorization
decision.  This is the reason many of the languages surveyed do not
support the feature.  The same effect can NOT be achieved, as the
authors incorrectly assert, via certificate revocation.  The
discussion of revocation belongs in section 3.1.8, Certificate
Validity.

There are other problems that must be corrected with the treatment of
revocation.  It is one of the features referred to in the second to
last sentence of section 2.4 as being located within the authorization
semantics in some languages and external to the same in
others. Although the statement here is somewhat ambiguous, my reading
here, and certainly in the conclusion, is that the authors acknowledge
that a trust management system should not be construed to consist
exclusively of its authorization semantics.  Thus at the top of the
second paragraph on page 27 when they say that RT does not admit
certificate revocation, they are misleading the reader.  RT does not
consider the various checks whether a certificate is currently valid
to be part of the authorization semantics.  However, if the authors
look at the end of section 7.1 of [Li et al. 2002], they will see that
revocation is certainly expected to be a part of a full TM system
based on RT.

The authors have not made what is in my mind an important distinction
between the validity of a certificate and the validity of its
content. It is true that much of the literature they survey also does
not make this distinction.  However, it bears on the subject of my
previous paragraph.  Certificates per se have a limited lifetime
because their verification normally depends on cryptographic
signatures.  There is no reason why an application-level policy should
be concerned with certificate-representation details such as how long
a signature should be considered unforgeable for the crypto system and
key length employed.  On the other hand, the content of the
certificate is concerned with information whose shelf-life may vary
dramatically and is certainly of concern to the application-level
policy.  Systems that cannot distinguish between these two forms of
validity are at a disadvantage.  On the other hand, a language such as
RT_1^C, that assumes signature validity is handled outside the
semantics, and that supports parameters and constraints, can ensure
that evidence of volatile attributes is appropriately fresh without
requiring evidence of unchanging attributes (e.g., year of birth) to
be reissued with unnecessary frequency.

It should be acknowledged that the difference between requiring a
recently issued CRL be checked and requiring a recently issued
certificate be checked is not significant at the level of the
authorization semantics.

On page 42, under Certificate Revocation, the authors state that
revocation is theoretically thorny because it introduces
non-monotonicity.  I think this has been more or less cleared up by Li
and Feigenbaum in Nonmonotonicity, User Interfaces, and Risk
Assessment in Certificate Revocation (Position Paper), In Proceedings
of the 5th International Conference on Financial Cryptography (FCí01)
2001, http://crypto.stanford.edu/~ninghui/papers/revocation_fc01.pdf.

The basic idea is that it remains the case indefinitely that the
issuer believed the content of the certificate when it was
issued. Depending upon the volatility of the belief and the use to
which the information will be put, the relying party and/or the policy
must decide how recently it is necessary that the issuing party held
the belief.  As a means of establishing that the belief was held
recently, checking a revocation list is just an alternative to getting
a fresher certificate.  At the point in the paper mentioned above, the
authors are not very clear about what point they are trying to make.
I think this stems from the fact that they are not entirely clear
about the subject themselves.  Do they think freshness needs to be an
explicit concept in the underlying semantics, or is it sufficient if
the underlying expressive power is sufficient to enable the policy
author to manage freshness herself.  Do they think the matter can be
adequately handled entirely outside the semantics (as they acknowledge
SPKI/SDSI tries to do)?  It would be nice if they could try to clarify
their thinking and the point they wish to make here in the
antepenultimate paragraph of the paper.

The authors have chosen to discuss the security analysis work of Li et
al. [2005] in the implementation section of RT. This is not
reasonable.  It is presented in that context in a manner that makes it
seem as though its aim is to answer authorization questions in a
distributed context.  This can be done by the RT system on its own;
the security analysis work is not needed for this purpose. So it is
misleading to write, "To study the complexity of authorization in a
distributed context, Li et al. address general security analysis
questions..."  The complexity of the authorization decision in a
distributed context was addressed by Li et al. [2003]. Don't get me
wrong.  I love the fact that the authors chose to talk about this
work.  I just think they make it sound as though RT evaluation is
intractable, which is definitely not the case.  The problem is that
this material doesn't fit under "implementation."  Not at all.  While
it's not the solution I would prefer, removing the discussion would
eliminate the problem.  Better would be to put it in an extra
discussion section somewhere.  (By the way, Li et al. [2005] has now
appeared, so the bibliography should be updated.)

There are a couple problems on page 5 with the glossary.  First, going
back to Blaze et al. [1996], a credential is just a signed policy
statement.  It may assign rights or, more generally, attributes, or it
may specify how rights or attributes can be derived.  But it should
not be confused with the right or attribute itself.  Also, be sure to
generalize rights to attributes.  These observations and suggestions
bear on how the Credential entry should be revised.  Second, the
Delegation of rights entry gives "transmission of credentials..." as a
definition.  This is highly misleading and must be rewritten in
different terms.  "Transmission" sounds like communication.  This is a
transfer not of information, but of authority or authorization,
depending on the type of delegation.

Some less problematic substantive concerns are as follows.

On p.6, six lines from the bottom, the authors write "...the
consequences of SPKI's revocation policy cannot be reasoned about
formally."  This over states the case.  We can reason formally about
the impact of things that are outside SPKI's formal structure.  The
question is whether the formalism by which authorization is specified
in SPKI is impoverished unacceptably by being unable to express
matters related to revocation.

On p.26, right after the numbered list, it probably isn't necessary to
introduce "subject" as it isn't used.  I'm suggesting this because the
sense in which the subject is "in" f is syntactic.  That is, it's not
a member of the set denoted by f.

The last sentence of the first paragraph of 5.2.3 (p.27) is
inaccurate.  Constraints are not used in RT_1 and RT_2.  They are used
in RT_1^C, a member of the family introduced by Li and Mitchell
[2003a].  The article should discuss RT_1^C and its difference from
RT_1.

At the top of p.29 it should probably be noted that the guarantee that
all credential chains can be found hinges on a type system that
assigns types to role names and places restrictions on how role names
of various types can be combined in well-typed credentials.

The remainder of this review consist of line by line suggestions and
corrections for the authors.

P5,L-2 (i.e., second line from the bottom on page 5): You might want
to consider avoiding using T_P and the like as a name here. The
subscript normally means the value is somehow parameterized by the the
subscript value.  In the current context, P is a policy.  But the
function T_P is independent of any policy. It takes a policy input,
that's true.  But by T_P you mean the function, not its output value
when applied to P.  All that said, a lot of people abuse notation this
way, so it's up to you.

P6,L-9: "cases cases"

P7,L3: I guess this is the first reference to RT_0, so perhaps there
should be a cite.

P7,L4: revise: "To authorized for a particular resource"

P9,L7: "Some while some"

P13, Certificate Validity: Be sure to discuss the fact that signatures
don't last forever, too.

P14,L2: "the system's formalism" is not a monolithic thing in the case
of RT.  The evaluation mechanism is different from and sound and
complete with respect to the semantics.  Chain discovery is part of
the evaluation mechanism, not the semantics.  I'm not sure how much of
this needs to be said.  The current phrasing just makes it sound a
little like obtaining certificates is part of the semantics.

P15,L-14: "None of the...": This is not accurate when X has the form
\{X\}_{K^{-1}}.

P16,L-17: and -> or  (i.e., "and" should be "or")

P16,L-9: is a role a kind of principal?  If so, say so above.

P17,L24: B -> A

P18,L5: What is meant by "atoms"?  I suggest you use "constants" as
"atoms" often means atomic formulas in logic programming literature.

P20,L5: or revoked -> or been revoked

P20,L12: K_A: reusing A (just used as a name in the prev. line) may
confuse some readers

P20,L24: "subsumes" may be a slightly confusing word choice since the
property of speaking for K2.A2 entails the property of speaking for
K1.A1.

P20,L29: described the -> described in the

P22,L-5: constrained -> defined ? 

P22,L-5: satisfying the -> satisfying the above equalities and the

P23,L4 of text: such associativity -> such as associativity

P23,L20: express -> formalize ?

P26,L19: A.s -> B.s

P26,L-2: separate -> separation

P27,L5: member or role -> member of role

P27,L5-6: "Hence, ...": the meaning of this sentence and why it
follows are not clear.

P32,L-18: finite of cofinite -> finite or cofinite
