It was an oversight to omit section 6 from the road map in section 1.2. We
have added an appropriate sentence to the end of section 1.2.

Corrected.

We appreciate the reviewer's "classical" view that citations should
not be treated as nouns, however this rule appears to be violated
often in modern computer science literature and as far as we can tell
is common practice. In any case the reviewer is correct that our
handling of citations should be consistent and certainly the
repetition of "Seamons et al."  is awkward. We have changed the text
as the reviewer suggested.

In the last paragraph of section 6 we comment on Protune's ability to
encode RT_0 credentials, and thus provide by way of simulation all the
features of RT_0. Since the running example is demonstrated using RT_0
in section 5.2.2 we feel this is a succinct way of explaining how
Protune can provide a number of the features mentioned in the
tables. We have elaborated on the last paragraph of section six to
make this point clearer and more explicit. We have also provided
citations at appropriate spots as pointers to further Protune details
relevant to other features in the tables besides just those provided
by RT_0.

This is a good suggestion especially considering that trust management
techniques could be applied to control the access of processes on the same
host. We have adjusted the wording of the definition.

> - def. of Role membership (p.6): I would prefer something like "[...] the

The suggested change is also more consistent with the wording used in the
definition of Role immediately above. We have adjusted the wording of the
definition.
