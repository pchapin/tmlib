\section{Review of Trust Management Systems}
\label{section-review}

In this section we review a collection of trust management systems.
We cover three systems in depth-- SPKI/SDSI, QCM and its successor
SD3, and RT-- and more briefly summarize a number of others.  We focus
on SPKI/SDSI, RT, and QCM and SD3 because together they represent a fairly
encompassing variety of approaches to trust management.  Our entire
review is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather representative of
the breadth of trust management systems.

For each of the three systems we cover in depth, we begin by providing
a summary overview of that system. We then describe the system's
features, as enumerated in Table~\ref{tbl:tmsummary1} and
Table~\ref{tbl:tmsummary2}, with an emphasis on those features that
are unique to the system or otherwise worthy of attention. We then
express the running example introduced in \autoref{section-overview},
in terms of the system's facilities. We follow this with a discussion
of the semantics of the system's core logic and finally observations
about system implementations.
