1. Give general overview of ABLP logic. What is it for?

2. Present syntax of principals, motivate each syntactic form (describe
   the intent).

3. Present syntax of primitive formulae, motivate each syntactic form
   (describe the intent).

4. Present inference rules, discuss
    - mention that logic is undecidable in general

5. Give an example inference (prefereably example 2.1 in Skalka & Wang
   SWS04)

6. Access control 
   - define and discuss "controls" connective
   - define and discuss ACLs
   - give example access control judgement
   - mention ACL decisions (of specific form) are 
     decidable, as discussed in paper

7. Delegation
   - define and discuss "for" connective (as defined
     on bottom of page 17)
   - define and discuss ACL modifications in presence
     of delegation with "for"
   - discuss why e.g. "A for B says s" is more powerful
     than "A says B says s"
