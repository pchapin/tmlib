Title: Risk Assessment in Distributed Authorization

In a large scale distributed system authorization decisions must make use
of potentially long chains of credentials to convey trust across
administrative boundaries. Numerous "trust management" systems have been
described in the literature that address how these credentials are
expressed, and how they interact. In these systems individual credentials
are typically considered to be either completely valid or completely
invalid. We have extended an existing trust management system (RT_0) to
allow risks to be associated with credentials. We develop a formal
semantics for our extension and describe an authorization algorithm that
avoids wasteful searching and yet remains sound with respect to the
semantics.
