                 the context of multiple sensitivity levels has been
                 widely studied. Especially noteworthy is Denning's work
                 in secure flow analysis and the lattice model [6][7].
                 Until now, however, the soundness of Denning's analysis
                 has not been established satisfactorily. We formulate
                 Denning's approach as a type system and present a
                 notion of soundness for the system that can be viewed
                 as a form of noninterference. Soundness is established
                 by proving, with respect to a standard programming
                 language semantics, that all well-typed programs have
                 this noninterference property.",

                 performance of SPIN, an extensible operating system.
                 SPIN provides an extension infrastructure together with
                 a core set of extensible services that allow
                 applications to safely change the operating system's
                 interface and implementation. These changes can be
                 specified with fine-granularity, allowing applications
                 to achieve a desired level of performance and
                 functionality from the system. Extensions are
                 dynamically linked into the operating system kernel at
                 application runtime, enabling them to access system
                 services with low overhead. A capability-based
                 protection model that relies on language and link-time
                 mechanisms enables the system to inexpensively export
                 fine-grained interfaces to system services. SPIN and
                 its extensions are written in Modula-3 and run on DEC

  abstract =     "Extensible systems, such as Java or the SPIN
                 extensible operating system, allow for units of code,
                 or extensions, to be added to a running system in
                 almost arbitrary fashion. Extensions closely interact
                 through low-latency, but type-safe interfaces to form a
                 tightly integrated system. As extensions can come from
                 arbitrary sources, not all of whom can be trusted to
                 conform to an organization's security policy, such
                 structuring raises the question of how security
                 constraints are enforced in an extensible system. In
                 this paper, we present an access control mechanism for
                 extensible systems to address this problem. Our access
                 control mechanism decomposes access control into a
                 policy-neutral enforcement manager and a security
                 policy manager, and it is transparent to extensions in
                 the absence of security violations. It structures the
                 system into protection domains, enforces protection
                 domains through access control checks, and performs
                 auditing of system operations. It works by inspecting
                 extensions for their types and operations to determine
                 which abstractions require protection, and by
                 redirecting procedure or method invocations to inject
                 access control operations into the system. We describe
                 the design of this access control mechanism, present an
                 implementation within the SPIN extensible operating
                 system, and provide a qualitative as well as
                 quantitative evaluation of the mechanism.",

  abstract =     "We identify the {"}trust management problem{"} as a
                 distinct and important component of security in network
                 services. Aspects of the trust management problem
                 include formulating security policies and security
                 credentials, determining whether particular sets of
                 credentials satisfy the relevant policies, and
                 deferring trust to third parties. Existing systems that
                 support security in networked applications, including
                 X.509 and PGP, address only narrow subsets of the
                 overall trust management problem and often do so in a
                 manner that is appropriate to only one application. We
                 present a comprehensive approach to trust management,
                 based on a simple language for specifying trusted
                 actions and trust relationships. We also describe a
                 prototype implementation of a {"}trust management
                 system,{"} called PolicyMaker, that can facilitate the
                 development of security features in a wide range of
                 network services. $<$P$>$ This paper was presented at

                 Wide Web by storm. Java allows web creators to
                 embellish their content with arbitrary programs which
                 execute in the web browser, whether for simple
                 animations or complex front-ends to other services. We
                 examined the Java language and the Sun HotJava,
                 Netscape Navigator, and Microsoft Internet Explorer
                 browsers which support it, and found a significant
                 number of flaws which compromise their security. These
                 flaws arise for several reasons, including
                 implementation errors, unintended interactions between
                 browser features, differences between the Java language

                 the language and the bytecode format. On a deeper
                 level, these flaws arise because of weaknesses in the
                 design methodology used in creating Java and the
                 browsers. In addition to the flaws, we discuss the
                 underlying tension between the openness desired by web

                 users, and we suggest how both might be accommodated.",

                 this difficulty poses se-rious problems for writing

                 inexpensive syntactic constraints that strengthen

                 facili-tate the implementation of secure systems. We
                 introduce two mechanisms:confined types to impose
                 static scoping on dynamic object references
                 andanonymous methods which do not reveal the identity
                 of the current instance (this). Confined types protect
                 objects from use by untrusted code, while anonymous
                 methods allow standard classes to be reused from
                 confined classes. We have implemented a verifier which
                 performs a modular analysis of Java programs and
                 provides a static guarantee that confinement is

                 combine the benefits of integration and distribution by
                 supporting an object based style of programming on top
                 of a node machine/local network hardware base. Our
                 experiment hypothesis is that such an architecture will
                 provide an environment conducive to building
                 distributed applications. This technical review is
                 written three years into the project. We begin by
                 summarizing the Eden system: its concepts, history,
                 status, and context. We next discuss the way in which
                 the task of supporting the Eden architecture is divided
                 between the kernel, the programming language, and
                 user-level (library) code; we describe the experiences
                 with paper designs and prototype implementations that
                 led us to this division of labor. We then show how
                 distributed applications make use of various aspects of
                 the Eden architecture. We conclude by providing some
                 preliminary evaluations based on our experiences to
                 date. The objective of our research is to assess the
                 benefits (in terms of programmability) and the costs
                 (in terms of necessary support) of our system
                 architecture. We feel we have gained insights on a
                 number of questions of relevance well beyound Eden or
                 Eden-like systems. o How should the job of supporting a
                 system such as Eden be divided between the kernel, the
                 programming language, and user-level (library) code? o
                 How do distributed applications make use of various
                 aspects of the Eden architecture (location
                 independance, concurrency, etc.)? o Of the many design
                 and implementation choices we have made, which are

                 system and gives the programmer more control over
                 dynamic linking. Our module system provides explicit
                 interfaces, multiple views of modules based on
                 hierarchical nesting, and more flexible name-space
                 management than the Java package system. Relationships
                 between modules are explicitly specified in module
                 description files. We provide more control over dynamic
                 linking by allowing import statements in module
                 description files to require that imported modules be
                 annotated with certain properties, which we implement
                 by digital signatures. Our module system is compatible
                 enough with standard Java that we have implemented it

  summary     = {In this paper we study polymorphic subtyping, where the subtyping
theory is \emph{not} required to be structural.  We observe that type
schemes with subtyping qualifications are strictly necessary in order
to obtain principal typing.  We identify a new instance relation on
typing judgements, the \emph{halbstark} relation.  It is a hybrid,
lying in strength between Mitchell's original instance relation and
Fuh and Mishra's lazy instance relation.  We present a sound and
complete type inference algorithm in the style of Milner's Algorithm
W.  The significance of the halbstark relation emerges from the fact that
the algorithm is \emph{generic} in that it admits replacing 
typing judgements by \emph{any} halbstark-equivalent judgements at any
point.  This provides a generalized correctness argument for Algorithm W
independent of any particular constraint simplification strategy
chosen.  Finally, we show that polymorphic typing judgements are
preserved under let-unfolding, let-folding, and
$\eta$-reduction, but not in general under $\beta$-reduction.  
The latter holds, though, if the subtyping discipline has the
\emph{decomposition} property, which says that two function types are
in a subtype relation only if their domain and range types are
in the appropriate contra-/covariant subtype relation.
