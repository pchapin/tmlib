# This test has a cycle over the derived edge. It terminates because of
# the upper bound on the risk used by the search. Although the maximum
# size of the Q seems (by experiment) to be linear in the upper bound on
# the risk, it feels like the runtime is much slower. Right now I'm not
# sure exactly why that is; clearly it's related to a large number of
# spurious ARRs being processed. In any case, it's not good. The
# expected output is (E, 30), (E, 50), (E, 70), etc up to the limit
# imposed by the bound.
