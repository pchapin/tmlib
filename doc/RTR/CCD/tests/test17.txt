# This test requires a linked role to be processed twice. The second
# time produces the "best" overall result even though the risk on
# derived edge is not changed. This illustrates that care must be taken
# if one attempts to avoid adding "unnecessary" derived credentials. It
# is important to trigger the search of the linked node whenever a new
# ARR reaches it. The expected result of this test should be equivalent
# to (M, 20) not (M, 35).
