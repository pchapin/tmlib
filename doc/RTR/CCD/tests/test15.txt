# In this test E can be in the support role A.s two different ways. The
# first way is direct, but the second way is via a derived edge created
# by E being in the support role. This opens up the possibility of
# looping infinitely; the algorithm might continually add new derived
# edges with ever increasing weights. The expected output should be
# equivalent to (E, 15).
