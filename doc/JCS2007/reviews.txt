Title: Risk Management for Distributed Authorization
Authors: C. Skalka, X.Sean Wang, P. Chapin

Comments: This paper proposes $RT^R$, a logic language that supports
per-role assignment of abstract risks and the aggregation of such
assigned risks via customizable aggregation operators. The paper also
presents an algorithm for discovering certificate chains under the
constraint and guidance of risks. Example applications of the proposed
language are also discussed. The work is mainly based on the RT
framework previously proposed by Li et. al.

I believe risks play a critical role in distributed trust management,
and it¡¯s thus important for RT to have the capability of
quantitatively measuring risks associated with certificates and the
trust delegation process. I found the paper well written and the
techniques well developed and justified. I have following questions
and comments:

1. The authors should explain the difference between this paper and
   its conference version in the introduction or related work. Now
   there is only a sentence saying the $RT^R$ language has been
   introduced ¡®in a simpler form¡¯ in the previous version.

2. As Section 5 suggests, the abstract risk in $RT^R$ can be
   instantiated for numerous purposes in addition to its natural
   interpretation. In contrast, I found the discussion of efficiency
   in Section 3.2 quite confusing and unimportant. A reader will
   likely misunderstand ¡®if certification of a particular credential
   would be too time-consuming¡¯ to be about the complexity of the
   $RT^R$ language, whereas the authors¡¯ intention is to refer to the
   time spent on obtaining the authorization due to administrative
   delays. In my opinion, Section 3 should rather be removed, and the
   discussion in Section 3.1 should go to the introduction.

3. One major concern is whether the intersection aggregation function
   $\otimes$ is really needed. By $RT^0$, if $A.r \leftarrow f_1\cap
   \ldots \cap f_n$ then we can be a member of $A.r$ only if we are
   the member of $f_1$ through $f_n$. From the point of view of risks,
   this is equivalent to the case where $A.r \leftarrow f_1, f_1
   \leftarrow f_2, f_2 \leftarrow f_3, \ldots$ because similarly here
   we can be a member of A.r$ only if we are the member of $f_1$
   through $f_n$. The risk of $A.r$ should be the computed using the
   aggregation $\oplus$ in both cases.  This might seem to be
   conflicting with the example about PGP discussed on page
   7. However, in PGP when a key requires the agreement of many
   authorities, the value of the key increases, but the risk of that
   key does not actually reduces. Assuming all authorities have the
   same risk (that is, the authority could be fake), then more
   authorities a key requires, more likely there is some fake
   authority and the key should not be issued. As another example, the
   issuance of a passport requires more IDs then the issuance of a
   theatre ticket. More value exists in the passport then in the
   ticket, but at the same time it is also more risky to issue a
   passport then a ticket. In my understanding, the PGP example is
   more about trust or value rather than about risk, and hence is not
   appropriate for supporting the needs for the $\otimes$ aggregation
   function. The authors might want to find a better example to show
   that the risk of a type-4 role really needs a different aggregation
   function than $\oplus$.

==========================

Referee 2: 

It is a well written paper. The contributions in formalising and
solving the stated problems is significant.  It should be accepted.

There are some language problems such as:

Page 1: Although e.g. cryptographic techniques provide
Page 3: In Sect. 2, (spell out section)

Page 3: The RoleExpressions of RTR, denoted f, are either entities or
roles or constructed from other role expressions by linking and
intersection. Formally, role expressions are generated by the
following grammar: f ::= A | A.r | A.r.r | f \ · · · \ f

The notation (linking and intersection) need Engliash explanation. It
is helpful to provide an example here.  (You have defined it later,
but more useful to given one or two sentence explanation here.
