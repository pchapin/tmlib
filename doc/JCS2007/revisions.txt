We believe that Section 3 is important and distinct from other
material in the paper, as a high level discussion of practical
motivations for the incorporation of risk into authorization models
(rather than particular instantiations of RT^R as in Section 5).

I'm not sure I understand this comment.  Surely the credential A.r <--
B.q /\ C.s is not semantically equivalent to the credentials A.r <--
B.q, B.q <-- C.s in RT_0.  Furthermore, I don't see how this could be
true even from the point of view of risks, because different
delegating authorities are involved, and the point is that imposing an
explicit conjunctive precondition says something particular about
risk.  Also, it seems impossible to encode delegation depth without a
distinct intersection aggregator.  However, the continuing comments
about PGP are apropos...

This is a good point about PGP keys.  The citation of the PGP example
to support the choice of a distinct intersection aggregation function
has been removed from page 7.

There is currently an english explanation of the four credential forms
on page 4, soon after their syntactic definition.
